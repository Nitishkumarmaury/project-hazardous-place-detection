# project-hazardous-place-detection
This Python project monitors rain impact across multiple locations, dynamically updating a Folium-based map and sending real-time alerts via Telegram. It simulates rainfall progression, adjusts impact levels, clears alerts after rain stops, and visualizes everything with color-coded map markers.
